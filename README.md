###Library Database System Based on Python, wxPython and SQLite
This is a simple library database system made by Ketian XU.

To run this program, you'd better make sure that you have Python 2.7 and wxPython 3.0.0.

Then: 

 1. Use `python init.py` to initialize the database and to create an administrator account when you run the program for the first time.
 2. Use `python main.py` to get the main frame working and choose functions as you like.
 3. There are two examples for you to add books to the database: `book.in`, `book2.in`.
 And there is also an example for you to test whether the program can handle clashes: `bookclash.in`.
